# Income_level-prediction
The aim of my this project is to apply several machine learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income, whether he makes more than $50,000 or not, using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.
# Dataset
The dataset that will be used is the Census income dataset, which was and contains about 199523 records and 42 features. My prediction task is to determine whether a person makes his income over 50k a year.
# Provision
  Python

  scikit-learn / sklearn

  Pandas

  NumPy

  matplotlib

#Workflow
 Perform data cleaning using pandas library. Which includes replacing the missing values which is marked with '?' in this dataset.
 Make a Exploratory Data Analysis on the data using pandas.
 Visualize distributions and correlation of features using seaborn and pandas.
 Used the preprocessing technique.
 To balanced data by using imblearn technique.
 Make a classification model for the classification of income.
 Try different classifiers and compare the accuracy of all the classifiers.
