# Income_level-prediction
The aim of my this project is to apply several machine learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income, whether he makes more than $50,000 or not, using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.
# Dataset
The dataset that will be used is the Census income dataset, which was and contains about 199523 records and 42 features. My prediction task is to determine whether a person makes his income over 50k a year.
